        2001(22), male. Currently studying in the Computer Engineering study program. The knowledge I have gained in this study program has given me a deep understanding of various aspects of computer technology, from hardware architecture
        and design to software development.
      </div>
      <hr />
      <div class="CN1">
        In my studies, I have learned about microprocessor design and programming, computer networking, operating systems, digital circuit design, and more. I enjoy applying this knowledge to solve complex problems, from assembling and
        optimizing computers to developing innovative software applications.
      </div>
      <div class="CN1">
        In addition, I am also interested in the latest developments in the technology industry, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). This is also supported by my experience in
        creating smart device projects and participating in the robotics community. I hope to continue developing my skills and knowledge in this field, so that I can contribute in facing future challenges in the world of technology.
      </div>
      <div class="CN1">
        I believe that the combination of understanding hardware and software is an important advantage in facing the ever-evolving world of technology. I am eager to participate in collaborative projects, both inside and outside the
        academic environment, that allow me to apply my knowledge and skills in solving real problems.
